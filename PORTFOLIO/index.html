          <p ><b>Introduction </b> </p> <br>
           <p >In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance, clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.</p>

            <p>Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world.<br>
                <br>
                Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium.<br>
                <br>
                Whether you have Premium or not, you can:<br><br>
                
                Get recommendations based on your taste<br>
                Build collections of music and podcasts<br>
                And more!<br>
                Spotify is available across a range of devices, including computers, phones, tablets, speakers, TVs, and cars, and you can easily transition from one to another with Spotify Connect.</p>
